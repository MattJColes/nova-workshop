## Understanding Nova Pro Prompts (10 min)

### The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

```
[Task] + [Context] + [Audience] + [Tone] + [Constraints]
```

**Example:**
```
Task: Write a tagline
Context: for a developer productivity tool
Audience: targeting senior developers
Tone: professional yet approachable
Constraints: under 10 words
```

### üé® The Designer's Advantage
As designers, you already think in:
- Brand voice
- Target personas
- Emotional impact
- Visual hierarchy

Apply these same principles to text!

## Exercise 1: The Happy Developer Story (15 min)

### Round 1: Basic Prompt
Try this first:
```
Write a tagline about a developer using AI
```

**What you'll likely get:** Generic, uninspiring copy

### Round 2: Enhanced Prompt
Now try:
```
Create a punchy tagline for a tech startup showing a developer 
who switched from manual coding to AI-assisted development. 
Emphasize time saved (50%) and creative freedom gained. 
Make it memorable and under 8 words. Avoid technical jargon.
```

### Round 3: Your Turn!
Create taglines for these scenarios:
1. Developer discovering AI for the first time
2. Team celebrating faster deployment
3. Company showcasing productivity gains

### üí° Pro Tip: The "Before/After" Formula
```
"From [pain point] to [solution] in [timeframe]"
"No more [problem]. Hello [benefit]."
"[Old way] is out. [New way] is in."
```

## Exercise 2: Marketing Copy Variations (20 min)

### The Multiplication Method
One concept ‚Üí Multiple formats

**Your Mission:** Take the concept "AI makes developers happier and more productive"

Create 5 variations of each:

### 1. Social Media Posts

**LinkedIn (Professional)**
```
Prompt: Write a LinkedIn post about developers using AI to boost 
productivity. Include a surprising statistic, personal insight, 
and call-to-action. Professional tone, 100-150 words.
```

**Twitter/X (Punchy)**
```
Prompt: Create a tweet thread (3 tweets) about developer happiness 
with AI tools. Make it conversational, include emojis, and end 
with a question to drive engagement.
```

**Instagram (Visual-First)**
```
Prompt: Write Instagram caption for image of happy developer. 
Start with attention-grabbing first line. Include 3-5 relevant 
hashtags. Inspirational but authentic tone.
```

### 2. Email Subject Lines

Test different psychological triggers:
- **Curiosity:** "The secret tool your dev team isn't using (yet)"
- **FOMO:** "Why 73% of developers already switched to AI"
- **Benefit:** "Ship features 2x faster starting today"
- **Question:** "Still coding everything manually?"
- **Personalization:** "[Name], your team could save 20 hours/week"

### 3. Call-to-Action Buttons

Beyond "Click Here":
- "Start Creating Faster ‚Üí"
- "See AI in Action"
- "Join Happy Developers"
- "Get Your Time Back"
- "Transform Your Workflow"

### üéØ A/B Testing Mindset
Always create variations to test:
- Emotional vs. Logical appeals
- Short vs. Long copy
- Feature vs. Benefit focus
- Urgent vs. Evergreen messaging

## Advanced Techniques (10 min)

### 1. Brand Voice Injection
```
Prompt: Rewrite this tagline in the style of [brand]:
- Apple: Minimalist, revolutionary
- Nike: Motivational, action-oriented  
- Slack: Friendly, conversational
```

### 2. Emotional Targeting
```
Create copy that evokes [emotion]:
- Relief: "Finally, coding without the headaches"
- Excitement: "Unleash your creative potential"
- Confidence: "Build like you've always imagined"
```

### 3. Constraint Creativity
```
Write this message with constraints:
- Only 5 words

- Using only questions
```
