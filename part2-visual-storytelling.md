## 🔧 Bedrock Console Setup for Nova Canvas (5 min)

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have requested model access for Amazon Nova Canvas
- If model access isn't already granted, follow these steps:
  1. **In the left sidebar**, expand "Configure and learn"
  2. **Click** "Model access" under Configure and learn
  3. **From the model provider dropdown**, select "Amazon"
  4. **From the model dropdown**, choose "Amazon Nova Canvas"
  5. **Click** "Request model access" if needed

### Step 1: Navigate to Image Playground
1. **In the left sidebar**, expand "Test"
2. **Click** "Image / Video playground" under Test
3. **You should see** a different interface optimized for image generation

### Step 2: Select Nova Canvas Model
1. **Select a model**: Categories = Amazon, Models = Nova Canvas
2. **You'll see:**
   - Model selector showing "Amazon Nova Canvas"
   - Prompt input panel for your text
   - Generated image display area
   - Configuration settings on the left
   - History of generated images below

### Step 3: Configure Image Settings

**Understanding the Parameters:**
These settings give you creative control, similar to adjusting camera settings in photography.

1. **Number of Images**: Set to 1-5 (start with 4 for variations)
   - *Why this matters*: Like creating multiple design concepts for a client
   - *Pro tip*: Generate 4 to see different interpretations of your vision

2. **Image Dimensions**: 1024x1024 (default, perfect for social media)
   - *Designer note*: Square format works for Instagram, LinkedIn posts
   - *Future enhancement*: Can be adjusted for different aspect ratios

3. **Prompt Strength Scale**: 8.0 (controls how closely the model follows your prompt)
   - *Think of it as*: Creative freedom slider (1 = very loose, 15 = very strict)
   - *Designer translation*: Like the difference between a rough sketch (low) and tight comp (high)
   - *Sweet spot*: 7-9 balances creativity with accuracy

4. **Seed**: Leave at 0 for random generation (or set specific number for reproducibility)
   - *Designer benefit*: Save seed numbers of images you love to recreate similar styles
   - *Use case*: Creating consistent visual series or iterating on a concept

### Step 4: Understanding the Interface
- **Prompt Input**: Where you'll type your image descriptions
- **Run Button**: Generates your images
- **Generated Images**: Displays your created images
- **Download**: Save images individually by clicking on them
- **Configuration Panel**: Adjust settings on the left

### Step 5: Image Refinement Tools

**The Designer's Secret Weapon:**
When an image is almost perfect but needs tweaking, click on any generated image to access powerful editing tools.

**Available Editing Options:**
1. **Generate Variations**
   - *What it does*: Creates similar versions with slight differences
   - *Designer use*: Like exploring design iterations quickly
   - *When to use*: Love the concept but want different angles/details

2. **Remove Objects**
   - *What it does*: Intelligently removes unwanted elements
   - *Designer parallel*: Like using content-aware fill in Photoshop
   - *Perfect for*: Cleaning up distracting background elements

3. **Replace Objects**
   - *What it does*: Swaps specific elements while keeping composition
   - *Example*: Change laptop brand, switch coffee cup style
   - *Pro tip*: Maintains lighting and perspective automatically

4. **Replace Background**
   - *What it does*: Keeps subject, changes entire environment
   - *Designer benefit*: Test same subject in different contexts
   - *Use case*: Moving developer from office to home setting

**Workflow Tip:** Generate 4 images → Pick best one → Use editing tools to perfect it

### Step 6: Test Your Setup
**Quick test prompt:**
1. **Type in the prompt input area:**
```
Modern tech office with plants, minimalist design, bright natural lighting
```
2. **Click the "Run" button**
3. **Expected result:** You should see 4 variations of a clean, modern office in the output area
4. **Try the editing tools:** Click on your favorite image and experiment with:
   - Generate variations to see different plant arrangements
   - Remove an object if something looks out of place
   - Replace the background to try a different office style

### 💡 Navigation Tips:
- Use browser tabs to keep both Text and Image playgrounds open
- Right-click images to "Open in new tab" for full resolution
- The "Seed" option helps create variations of similar images
- Save prompts that work well in your notes

## The Art of Visual Prompting (15 min)

### Anatomy of a Perfect Image Prompt

```
[Subject] + [Action/Pose] + [Environment] + [Style] + [Lighting] + [Mood] + [Technical specs]
```

### Visual Vocabulary Essentials

**Why This Matters:** AI understands visual language just like you do. The more specific your vocabulary, the better your results.

**Composition Terms That AI Understands:**
- **Rule of thirds** → Creates balanced, professional layouts
- **Leading lines** → Guides viewer's eye to key elements
- **Symmetrical/asymmetrical** → Control formality vs. dynamism
- **Close-up/wide shot** → Emotional impact vs. context
- **Bird's eye view/worm's eye view** → Authority vs. aspiration

**Style Descriptors (With Marketing Impact):**
- **Photorealistic** → Builds trust, shows real results
- **Minimalist** → Premium, focused messaging
- **Corporate professional** → B2B credibility
- **Tech/futuristic** → Innovation positioning
- **Warm and inviting** → Approachable brands
- **Clean and modern** → Efficiency and clarity

**Lighting Magic (Emotion Through Light):**
- **Golden hour** → Optimism, new beginnings
- **Soft diffused light** → Approachable, friendly
- **Dramatic shadows** → Bold, decisive
- **Rim lighting** → Premium, standout
- **Natural daylight** → Authentic, transparent
- **Studio lighting** → Professional, controlled

**Pro Designer Tip:** Combine 3-4 terms for precision. Example: "minimalist composition, soft diffused lighting, rule of thirds, clean modern style"

### 🎯 Consistency Tips for Visual Storytelling

**The Designer's Challenge:** Creating a cohesive campaign across multiple images.

**Your Consistency Toolkit:**

1. **Character Consistency**
   - Use same descriptors: "mid-30s developer, short brown hair, blue shirt"
   - *Why it works*: Like casting the same actor in your campaign
   - *Designer parallel*: Brand guidelines for people photography

2. **Style Consistency**
   - Lock in your style: "Professional photography, shallow depth of field, Canon 85mm lens look"
   - *Designer benefit*: Creates recognizable visual signature
   - *Think of it as*: Your campaign's visual DNA

3. **Color Story**
   - Define palette: "Cool blue tones, touches of warm orange, desaturated overall"
   - *Marketing impact*: Instant brand recognition
   - *Pro move*: Reference specific color temperatures (5600K daylight)

4. **Composition Framework**
   - Stick to rules: "Always rule of thirds, subject on left third"
   - *Why this matters*: Creates visual rhythm across assets
   - *Designer insight*: Like using consistent grid system

**Save This Recipe:** When you nail the look, save your exact prompt as your "style guide" for the campaign
